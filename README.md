## Tulips (not the flower)

A tulip is a pictorial representation of the route. Each junction along the route is drawn as a small diagram which shows the design of the junction, and the route to follow at that point. In their most straightforward form, the tulip will show the exact arrangements of roads at the junction, oriented with respect to the car or else to the map. A large dot shows which branch you enter along, and an arrow shows which branch to leave along ("dots and arrows"). Such tulips are incredibly easy to use, and if given the route in this form, you may not need to draw the route on the map at all.

Tulips are also used in road books on other types of motorsports events, such as stage rallies, classic runs, treasure hunts and so on. You are bound to come across them sooner or later.

## Roadbook

Roadbook is a set of instructions for navigation that eliminates the need for a map. Something like this:

Use Excel, Word or Libre Office to generate the tables, create the tulips using Tulip Composer and you are set. If someone want to donate a roadbook template for this site I will be grateful.
